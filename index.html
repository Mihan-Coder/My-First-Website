     <p>The native people of Sajek valley are ethnic minorities. Among them Chakma, Marma, Tripura, Pankua, Kaibarta, Lushai, other indigenous Assamese communities, and Sagma are mentionable. Women seem to be more involved in economic activities here.[citation needed] Tea stalls, food joints and roadside marketplaces are dominated by women.[citation needed] Picking fruits and vegetables early in the morning is a common trade here.[citation needed] They are not fluent in Bengali but the young population speak some English.[5]</p>

     <h1 class="alighn">Saint Martin</h1>
     <p>Millennia ago, the island used to be an extension of the Teknaf peninsula, but at a later time some portion of this peninsula got submerged and thus the southernmost part of the aforementioned peninsula became an island, and was disconnected from the Bangladesh mainland. The first settlement started 250 years ago, in 18th century, by Arabian merchants who named the island 'Jazira'. During British occupation the island was named after the then Deputy Commissioner of Chittagong Mr. Martin as St. Martin Island. Likely because one or more of the Arabs were Saint and whose name could not be identified. Local names of the island are "Narikel jinjira"[3] which means 'Coconut Island', and "Daruchini Dwip" which means "Cinnamon island". It is the only coral island in Bangladesh.</p>
